      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently a data analyst looking to make the transition from data science into 
        web development. I majored in psychology in college, but by junior year had discovered a love of
        data and programming. I am also an all-purpose nerd and general sci-fi fan!
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am originally from Houston, TX.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are drawing, painting, gaming, and reading. I also enjoy Lego building!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is a front end developer working for an organization making a positive change in the world.
        I think that I will be able to combine my love of programming and art to create and maintain beautiful websites and applications.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in sunny San Diego.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always found programming to be fun and fulfilling. I enjoy getting to solve complex problems
        all day and am a natually logical thinker. I am also very interested to see what the next evolution of 
        the web will be, having started using it in the transition from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0!
